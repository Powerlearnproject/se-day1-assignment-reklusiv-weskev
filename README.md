#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineerin principles, methods and tools for the developmen and maintenance of high quality software systems. Software engineering under the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power certain aspects of modern life like commerce and entertainment

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the development of programming languages like python , C and Java 
2. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
3. the advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
There are six phases in the SDLC whereby all are very essential in ensuring that high quality and need satisfying software products are developed.
1. Requirement; which basically involves gathering and documenting both the needs of the user and the system
2. Design; here, there is creation of detailed and high level designs of the software architecture and the user interface
3. Implementation; which involves writing code and building the software according to design spesifications
4. Testing; whereby tests are conducted to ensure the software is upto standards and meets functional requirements
5. Deployment; which is the releasing of the software to users
6. Maintenance; involves updating and maybe enhancing it to suite a modern development in technology


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile methodologies are both used in software development. They differ in the sense that waterfall as a methodology is more centered on the sequential approach whereby distinct phases flow downwards like a waterfall whereas the agile methodology is more on the iterative and incremental approach focusing on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change    


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions, a Quality Assurance Engineer has the role of ensuring quality of software by designing and executing test plans whereas a Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are iomportant by the fact that they provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code for example Visual Studio. VCS on the other hand are important as they provide software tools for tracking changes to source code; an example is Git 



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing Requirements; This can be overcome by effective and timely communication to avoid delays to the project
2. Tight Deadlines; This challenge can be overcome by prioritization of tasks and using agile methodologies
3. Technical Debt; a way to combat this is to use agile methodologies when developing software 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testingindividual components and/or modules of software; Integration testing is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems; System testing involves testing of entire software systems as a whole; Acceptance Testing involves testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is simply the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models; It is important in the sense that it helps improve interaction between humans and AI


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: What is anatomy?
Improved Prompt: Acting as a certified Anatomy Proffessor, explain in light and simple words what anatomy is to a 5 year old African Child ; also employ the use of emojis

The improved prompt is more effective as it is contextualized and gives clear instructions to an AI model hence the output will most likely satisfy you.
